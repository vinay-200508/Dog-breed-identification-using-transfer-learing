# 🐶 Dog Breed Classifier

A Deep Learning–based Dog Breed Classification system built using **TensorFlow** and **Keras**.  
This model predicts the breed of a dog from an input image using a trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Dog Breed Classifier** is a computer vision project designed to automatically identify dog breeds from images. The system leverages deep learning techniques to extract visual features and classify images into learned breed categories.

This project demonstrates:

- Image Classification using Deep Learning  
- CNN / Transfer Learning Techniques  
- Model Inference with Keras  
- Practical AI Application Development

## ✨ Features

✔ Dog breed prediction from images  
✔ Pretrained model included  
✔ Supports common image formats (`.jpg`, `.png`)  
✔ Easy inference pipeline  
✔ Clean, lightweight project structure

## 🧠 Model Information

The repository contains pretrained Keras models:

- `dog_breed_model.h5`
- `dog_breed_model.keras`

These models can be directly loaded for prediction without retraining.

## 📂 Dataset

Training data is included as:

- `data.zip`

This archive contains labeled dog breed images used to train the classifier.

> *(Dataset details such as number of breeds depend on the training configuration.)*
